  #                ------------> foo-c
  #
  # Assuming foo-* are all systems in the same source derivation. This edge case
  # is the most complicated, and it’s the reason for this entire
  # pre-parsing-dependency-tracking quagmire. It’s not unusual with -test
  # derivations. This graph is solved by incrementally including the dependent
  # systems in the parent derivations, and rebuilding them all. So, with an
  # arrow indicating the lispDependencies:
  #
  # [foo-a & foo-b & foo-c] -> bar -> [foo-b & foo-c] -> zim -> foo-c
  #
  # Complications:
  # - The derivation doing the deduplication of foo-b and foo-c is not, itself,
  #   a foo, so it doesn’t have easy access to an authoritative definition of
  #   foo. It must recognize from the two separate derivations that they are
  #   equal, and construct an entirely new foo that encapsulates them both.
  # - If any of the systems is defined with doCheck = true, this affects the
  #   build, and the final combined derivation must also be built with checks.
  # - If you rebuild fully from source every time, e.g. foo-{a,b,c}, foo-c will
  #   only be built because it is a dependency of zim. ASDF’s cache tracking
  #   mechanism causes any system /whose dependencies must be rebuilt/ itself
  #   also stale. This means a rebuild of foo-c would cause a rebuild of
  #   zim--that will fail, because zim is in the store. The only solution to
  #   this is to fetch the prebuilt cache of foo-c by making foo-c the src of
  #   foo-b, and foo-b the src of foo-a.
  #
  # Note that bar only depends on a single "foo" derivation, which is built with
  # foo-b and foo-c; not on two copies of foo, one with b & c, one with just c.
